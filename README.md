 **Furniture Sales Analysis Dashboard**


Furniture is more than just tables and chairs it’s comfort, style, and the foundation of every space we call home. Behind every sofa purchase and office desk upgrade lies a story of choice: the category, the design, the price point, the season, and the customers who return because quality matters to them.
As a data analyst for this furniture business, my mission is to look beyond the showroom and uncover the patterns hidden within the numbers from sales trends and customer preferences to shipping performance and regional demand. By analyzing this data, we can identify what sells best, when customers buy the most, and where growth opportunities truly exist.
This data isn’t just about sales it’s about building smarter strategies, improving customer experience, and furnishing the path to sustainable business success.

 **Business Problem**


The goal of this project is to analyze furniture sales performance across different regions in the United States and uncover key business insights that can support data-driven decision-making. The analysis specifically aims to:

•	Evaluate overall sales performance using key metrics (Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and YoY growth)

•	Identify the most frequently used shipping modes and their distribution

•	Analyze monthly sales trends and highlight peak sales periods

•	Assess shipping duration patterns and delivery efficiency

•	Determine top-performing furniture categories by sales

•	Analyze state-wise sales distribution using geographic visualization

•	Identify top-performing cities based on order quantity

•	Enable dynamic analysis through interactive filters (Region and Segment)




**Methodology**

This project followed an end-to-end Excel dashboard development process designed to simulate real-world business analysis. The dataset underwent a structured workflow consisting of data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization using Excel tools such as Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts. These steps ensured data accuracy, consistency, and the creation of meaningful insights.



**Data Preparation and Transformation**

*Data Cleaning*

•	Raw sales data was imported into Excel and reviewed for consistency and completeness.

•	Data types (dates, numeric fields, and text fields) were validated to ensure correct aggregation and calculations.

•	Inconsistencies in categorical fields (such as shipping modes and product categories) were standardized.


*Data Transformation (Power Query)*

•	Power Query was used to clean and reshape the dataset efficiently.

•	Date fields were prepared to enable monthly and year-on-year (YoY) analysis.

•	Calculated fields such as total sales, profit, and quantity metrics were validated for accuracy.


*Data Analysis and Visualization*

After data preparation, Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts were used to perform exploratory and explanatory analysis, resulting in a comprehensive interactive dashboard.



**Key Metrics (KPI Section)**

The dashboard displays Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity, alongside Year-on-Year (YoY) percentage growth, providing a quick snapshot of overall business performance.

*Key Insight:*

The business recorded total sales of $724.0K, with 8.0K units sold and a total profit of $18.5K. While sales volume is strong, the relatively low profit indicates thin margins, suggesting opportunities for cost optimization and pricing strategy improvements.



**Sales Trend (Monthly Analysis)**

A line chart illustrates monthly sales trends, with the peak sales month clearly highlighted.

*Key Insight:*

Sales fluctuate across the year, with December emerging as the peak sales month, generating $121,818 in revenue. This pattern suggests strong seasonal demand, likely driven by holiday purchases and year-end promotions.



**Shipping Mode Analysis**

A chart shows the distribution of shipment methods, highlighting the most frequently used shipping modes

*Key Insight:*

Standard Class was the dominant shipping method, accounting for 59% of total orders, indicating a strong preference for cost-effective delivery options among customers.



**Shipping Duration Analysis**

Shipping duration (delivery days) is visualized to show the distribution of delivery times.

*Key Insight:*

The most common delivery duration was 4 days, representing 28% of all orders, suggesting that a significant proportion of customers receive their orders within a moderate and acceptable timeframe.


 
 
 **Category Performance (Furniture)**

Top furniture categories are ranked by total sales using a bar chart.

*Key Insight:*

The Chair category recorded the highest sales, totaling $328,449, making it the strongest revenue contributor among all furniture categories.



**State-wise Sales Distribution**

A geographic map visualization displays total sales by U.S. state.

*Key Insight*

Sales performance varies significantly across states, revealing high-performing regions as well as underpenetrated markets that may benefit from targeted sales or marketing strategies.



**Top Cities by Quantity**

A bar chart highlights cities with the highest order quantities.

*Key Insight:*

New York City emerged as the top-performing city, generating approximately $73.7K in sales, positioning it as a key market for focused marketing and distribution efforts.



**Interactive Filters (Slicers)**

Region and Segment slicers were added to enable dynamic filtering across all visuals.

*Key Insight:*

These filters allow users to drill down into specific customer segments or regions, uncovering localized trends and enabling customized analysis without altering the underlying data.



**Recommendation and Implications**

Regional Strategy: High-performing cities such as New York City should be prioritized for targeted marketing and faster delivery options, while underperforming regions may benefit from tailored promotional campaigns.

Category Optimization: Since chairs generate the highest revenue ($328,449), inventory planning and promotional efforts should prioritize this category while exploring growth opportunities in other furniture segments.

Shipping Efficiency: With 59% of orders shipped via Standard Class, optimizing this shipping mode for cost and delivery time could significantly improve profit margins.

Sales Seasonality: The strong December peak ($121,818) indicates the need for increased inventory and marketing activities ahead of year-end demand.

Delivery Performance:  Since 28% of orders are delivered in 4 days, maintaining or improving this delivery window could enhance customer satisfaction and retention




**Conclusion**

The Furniture Sales Performance Dashboard provides a clear, interactive, and data-driven overview of sales trends, logistics performance, and regional demand across the United States. By leveraging Excel tools such as Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts, the project demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into actionable business insights.
